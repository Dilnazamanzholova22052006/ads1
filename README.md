# Overview

*assignment 1* of the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course.
This project was implemented for the first assignment of the course.As required, with the help of my project, the user will have the right to choose in the implementation of methods.Therefore, i use "switch"construction.My work represents the realization of 10 methods:
finding the minimum element of an array, 
finding the average, checking a number for prime,
finding the factorial of a number, the nth 
number of a Fibonacci sequence, finding the 
nth power of a number, reversing the order of 
an array, checking a string for a digit, 
finding the binomial coefficient, and 
finding GCD.By requirements of you,i give choose for user to choose method to use.


# How to Use

1. Clone repository.
2. Open the project in **Intellij IDEA** or any other ***Java*** IDE.
3. Compile and run file **Main.java**.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions: *choose method*, *input required parameters*.
5. The output for chosen method will be displayed in *terminal*.</br>
Methods:



1.Find minimum element in array.Return type:int.




2.Find average of given array.Return type:float.




3.Check if number is prime or composite.Return type:boolean.




4.Find factorial of number by recursive function.Return type:int




5.Find Fibonacci sequence by given number.Return type:int.



6.Find a^n.Return type:int.



7.Find reverse of given array.Return type:int[].



8.Check for consisting digits in given string.Return type:boolean.



9.Find binomial coefficient by given numbers.Return type:int.



10.Find Greatest Common Divisor by given numbers.Return type:int.
